# Solar System Project

## Why?

Simply for fun and to improve in Three.js

## About the project

This a small project that represents the solar system, it may not be an exact replica but I tried my best.

### The 3D objects:

    - Sun
    - Mercury
    - Venus
    - Earh *with the moon*
    - Mars
    - Jupiter
    - Saturn
    - Uranus
    - Neptune
    - Pluto (Even though it's a dwarf planet, i still included it since it was considered a planet when I was in school).

## Will I optimise this project?

A vesion 2 is avalable [here](https://github.com/DragosNH/SolarSystem_2.0).
